Laser Light can damage the human eyes and skin. Do not expose the eye or skin to laser light directly. This Laser product has an optical lens and emits a 
collimated laser beam. The light from this product, both direct and reflected, is very harmful as it can propagate a long distance while maintaining high 
optical density. When handling the product, wear appropriate safety glasses (OD5+) to protect eyes from laser light including reflected and stray light. 
The reflected and stray light spilling into an unintended area should be attenuated and/or absorbed. 
2.1  Laser safety
We installed a laser shield on the laser, the shield can largely filter out the diffuse reflection of the laser spot.However, when using laser engraving 
machine, it is recommended that you wear laser protective glasses. Avoid skin exposure to type 4 laser beams, especially at close range.Teenagers must 
have parental supervision in the process of using it.Do not touch the laser engraving module when the machine is on.
2.2 Fire Safety
Because cutting burns off the substrate, a high-intensity laser beam generates extremely high temperatures and a lot of heat.Certain materials can catch 
fire during cutting, creating gases and fumes inside the equipment.A small flame usually appears here when a laser beam hits the material.It will move 
with the laser and will not stay lit when the laser passes by.Please do not leave the machine unattended during the carving process.After use, be 
sure to clean up debris, debris and flammable materials in the laser cutting machine.Keep a working fire extinguisher nearby at all times.Smoke or air 
pollutant safety. When laser engraving machines are used, smoke, vapour, particles, and potentially highly toxic materials (plastics and other 
combustible materials) are produced from the material.These fumes or air pollutants can be hazardous to health.
