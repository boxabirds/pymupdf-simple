Installation Manual:
 1. As shown in the figure, fix the Y-axis limit 
column with M 3* 14 screws on the left slide rail.
 2. Adjust the eccentric nut to ensure that the X-
axis and Y-axis move smoothly without shaking.
TIPS：
How to determine the tightness of eccentric nuts?
Under the condition of ensuring that the bracket does 
not shake, you can lift one end of the machine to an 
angle of  45 degrees with the horizontal plane, and 
release the X-axis or Y-axis bracket from a high place. 
If the bracket can slide at a constant speed to the end, 
the tightness is suitable.
