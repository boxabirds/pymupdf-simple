Installation Manual:
1. Install two synchronous belts as shown in the figure. First 
tighten one end with a T-nut, then pass the other end 
through the roller on the X-axis assembly as shown in the 
figure, and finally tighten the other end and fix it with a T-
nut.
2. T-nut fixing method (Push the T-nut from the groove on 
the end of the profile, and then use the screw to tighten the 
T-nut), the T-nut is as close to the end of the profile as 
possible, and cut off the excess belt.
3. Cover the profile end cover (the side of the end cap with 
protrusions is facing down)
TIPS:
The installation of the Y-axis synchronous belt can refer to 
the installed synchronous belt on the X-axis 
assembly.Determine whether the timing belt is tight enough: 
press the position shown in Figure 4 with your fingers, and if 
there is no obvious deformation, it is tight enough. If the 
deformation is large, loosen one end of the T-nut and 
tighten the timing belt, and then tighten the T-nut.
